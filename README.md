HTML CSS: Your First Lab!
---

## Objectives

1. Solve a lab on learn
2. Submit your solution using `learn submit` in the IDE

## Instructions

Welcome to your first lab on Learn! We promise, this'll be easy.

First, pull the repository associated with this lab into your workspace. In the terminal in Learn IDE, run

``` bash
learn open html-css-your-first-lab
```

This should pull down all of the resources that you need and open up the folder containing the lab for you.

Next, find the file called `my_first_lab.html` and open it for editing in the IDE. To solve this lab, you'll need to change the text between `<strong>` and `</strong>` so that instead of saying "NAME" it says your name.

(HINT: If you'd like to take a look at your handiwork, you can preview this in your browser by right-clicking the file in the file tree, and selecting "Open in Browser" .)

Then, in the terminal in Learn IDE, run

``` bash
learn submit
```

If all you've followed along, you should see a success message and your lab should be submitted! Head back to the page for this lesson on learn.co, and you'll see that all of your green lights are lit!

Congratulations â€” you've just solved your first lab!
